%The main paper regression tables can be replicated by running the do.file "main.do" 
(except table 5: the unilateral specification and table 8, the placebo). 
This do-file also contains replication codes for the first-stages counterparts of the main paper tables.

Placebo regressions can be replicated by running the "placebo.do" file.
Supplemental material regressions can be replicated by running the "supplemental.do" file.


To run the replications, open the do.files and change the current directory to your own machine's directory.
